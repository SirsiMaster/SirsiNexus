# Sirsi Nexus Comprehensive Development Blueprint

A dense, end-to-end specification for a production-ready, agent-embedded migration & infrastructure platform. This single document fuses the CMP v2.0 features, the seven-step migration rubric, UI/UX patterns, security, CI/CD, and the Sirsi AI Agent hypervisor into one cohesive, fully agentic plan.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Goal**: Ship _Sirsi Nexus_—a unified application delivering both a cross-platform desktop single-binary and a multi-tenant hosted web app—automating heterogeneous cloud migrations and infrastructure management. Every user and every feature is supported by the _Sirsi AI Hypervisor_, which dynamically spawns specialized, parallelized _sub‑agents_ (e.g., Azure Agent, AWS Agent, Migration Agent, Reporting Agent, Security Agent, Scripting Agent) to provide deep domain knowledge, continuous monitoring, and context-aware assistance.

**Key Pillars**:

1. **Agent-First Everywhere**: The Hypervisor maintains an always-on _AgentService_ that spawns domain-specific sub-agents. Each sub-agent has full-system visibility in its domain, acts autonomously on tasks (discovery, assessment, planning, execution, reporting), and surfaces recommendations and interactive tutorials.
2. **Modular Polyglot Core**: Leverage Rust (core hypervisor, state machine), Go (connectors, sub-agent runtimes), Python (planning, AI orchestration), TypeScript/WebAssembly (UI logic), and Helm/Terraform for infrastructure. All communicate over protobuf/gRPC and an event bus (Kafka/NATS).
3. **Robust, Feature-Rich UI/UX**: Built with Next.js + React, styled via Tailwind + shadcn/ui, animated using Framer Motion. The sidebar provides one-click access to every module—Discovery, Assessment, Planning, Execution, Validation, Optimization, Reporting, Security, Scripting, FAQs, and Tutorials—each backed by live content and no empty states. A global AgentChat icon injects contextual help into every form, modal, and dashboard.
4. **Security & Compliance by Design**: Zero trust using mTLS and SPIFFE for identity, dynamic secrets via HashiCorp Vault, policy-as-code enforced by OPA at both CI and runtime, and runtime sandboxing of untrusted code modules via gVisor and eBPF-based anomaly detection.
5. **Scalable, Resilient Infrastructure**: Kubernetes Operators to manage migration CRDs, auto-scaling via HPA and custom metrics, multi-region disaster recovery with etcd replication and cross-region object storage, and event-driven workflows for high throughput.
6. **Enterprise-Grade CI/CD & Testing**: Comprehensive GitHub Actions/Azure Pipelines setup for linting (Clippy, ESLint, GoLint), unit tests (Rust, Go, Python, Jest), integration tests (Testcontainers, KIND), end-to-end UI tests (Cypress), security scans (Snyk, Trivy), and performance baselining (K6, Lighthouse).

```  
**Contracts**: All services share versioned proto definitions under `core-engine/proto/*.proto`. Events adhere to schemas in `pipeline/schemas/`.

## 2.1 GUI-First Development Approach

To keep the interface "alive" during early development, the project begins by scaffolding the entire UI and CLI with mocked data. Every screen, modal and dashboard is implemented first, then real services and sub-agents replace the placeholders incrementally. This approach validates workflows early and guides backend priorities.

## 3. Phase-by-Phase Roadmap

### Phase 0: Preparation & Monorepo Scaffolding
- Initialize a unified monorepo with Yarn Workspaces, Cargo Workspace, and Go Modules.
- Establish CI seeds: Actions matrix, semantic-release, branch protection rules.
- Draft a full Mermaid/PlantUML architecture diagram at `docs/architecture.mmd`.

### Phase 1: UI & CLI Foundations (Feature-Rich, Agent-Embedded)
#### 1.1 Design System & Navigation
- Tailwind config tokens for Sirsi palette and typography.
- `<Sidebar>` component with entries for each sub-agent's domain feature home: Overview, Migration Wizard, Credential Management, Projects, Migration Steps (Plan, Specify, Test, Build, Transfer, Validate, Optimize, Support), Analytics & Reports, Help & Tutorials.
- `<AgentChat>` overlay always available; contextual tooltips and input field assistants.

#### 1.2 Core Components & Screens
- **WelcomeModal**: JSON-driven steps, Framer Motion animations, embedded Agent greeting.
- **ProjectForm**: React Hook Form + Zod, real-time AI tips, immediate validation, icons in dropdowns.
- **AuthModal**: Tabbed Sign In/Register, OIDC flows, demo credentials section, AI prompt for MFA.
- **MigrationSteps**: Wizard flow with sub-agent interactions at each step, pre-populated real content from events.

#### 1.3 CLI Interface
- Tauri-based binary bundling Rust core and React UI.
- `sirsi` CLI with subcommands (`init`, `discover`, `assess`, `plan`, `run`, `status`, `help`) and interactive REPL mode with Agent autocompletion.

### Phase 2: Core AI Hypervisor & Sub-Agent Framework
1. **Hypervisor Core (Rust)**
   - Implement `AgentService` gRPC with methods: `StartSession`, `SpawnSubAgent(type)`, `SendMessage`, `GetSuggestions`, `GetSubAgentStatus`.
   - Context store: Redis cluster for session data, user profiles, and workspace state.
2. **Sub-Agent Manager**
   - Dynamic loading of sub-agent modules as WASM or Go binaries.
   - Domain-specific sub-agents: AzureAgent, AWSAgent, MigrationAgent, ReportingAgent, SecurityAgent, ScriptingAgent, TutorialAgent.
   - Communication bus: Agents publish and subscribe to Kafka topics: `agent.{domain}.requests`, `.responses`, `.logs`.
3. **Knowledge Graph Integration**
   - Hedera Hashgraph client in Rust to persist user interactions, resource graphs, and agent decisions as a 3D relationship map.
4. **Security Bootstrapping**
   - Configure SPIRE to issue mTLS certificates to each service and sub-agent.
   - Vault sidecar injector for dynamic secret retrieval, annotated in Kubernetes manifests.
5. **Observability Setup**
   - OpenTelemetry collector deployment, instrumentation of all services, and Kafka staging topics.

### Phase 3: Connector Framework & Discovery Sub-Agent
- Define `ConnectorRequest` and `ConnectorResponse` messages in `proto/connector.proto`.
- Implement AWSAgent, AzureAgent, GCPAgent, vSphereAgent in Go under `connectors/{provider}`.
- Each agent: Auth via SDK, resource enumeration, metadata enrichment, and publication to `discovery.events` with embedded AI prompts for optimization.
- Build a Go Testcontainers harness with LocalStack, Azurite, and Mock vSphere for CI integration tests.

### Phase 4: Assessment & Risk Sub-Agent
- Dagster pipelines in Python for `discovery.events` ingestion.
- OPA policies in `security/opa/` to evaluate compliance, sizing, OS support.
- ML-based scorer (`models/scorer.pkl`) to compute cost, performance, and security risk.
- Publish `assessment.events` with `riskScore`, `costEstimate`, `aiRecommendation`.
- AssessmentAgent listens for high-risk events and proactively messages users or opens action items.

### Phase 5: Migration Planning & Scripting Sub-Agent
- Template engine: Jinja2 (Python) & Tera (Rust) to fill `migration-templates/*.tpl` (Terraform HCL, Bicep, Pulumi TS).
- ScriptingAgent validates synthesized IaC, offers inline code-edit suggestions via AI, and writes back updated templates.
- Expose `/api/plan` endpoints for UI and CLI; generate Mermaid diagrams at `/api/plan/diagram`.

### Phase 6: Core User Flows, Agent Use Cases & No-Empty States
