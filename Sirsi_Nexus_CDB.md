## 1. Core Capabilities & Design Principles

1. **Full-Stack AI Integration**: Every component embeds an agent for contextual assistance, code generation, and workflow optimization.
2. **Multi-Cloud Discovery**: Automated resource enumeration and relationship mapping across AWS, Azure, GCP, and vSphere.
3. **Risk-Aware Planning**: ML-powered assessment of migration complexity, cost, and security implications.
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated generation and validation of Terraform, Bicep, and Pulumi templates.
5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Kafka/NATS backbone for real-time progress tracking and agent coordination.
6. **Enterprise-Grade CI/CD & Testing**: Comprehensive GitHub Actions/Azure Pipelines setup for linting (Clippy, ESLint, GoLint), unit tests (Rust, Go, Python, Jest), integration tests (Testcontainers, KIND), end-to-end UI tests (Cypress), security scans (Snyk, Trivy), and performance baselining (K6, Lighthouse).

## 2. High-Level Architecture

```  

**Contracts**: All services share versioned proto definitions under `core-engine/proto/*.proto`. Events adhere to schemas in `pipeline/schemas/`.

## 2.1 GUI-First Development Approach

To keep the interface "alive" during early development, the project begins by scaffolding the entire UI and CLI with mocked data. Every screen, modal and dashboard is implemented first, then real services and sub-agents replace the placeholders incrementally. This approach validates workflows early and guides backend priorities.

## 3. Phase-by-Phase Roadmap

### Phase 0: Preparation & Monorepo Scaffolding
- Initialize a unified monorepo with Yarn Workspaces, Cargo Workspace, and Go Modules.
- Establish CI seeds: Actions matrix, semantic-release, branch protection rules.
- Draft a full Mermaid/PlantUML architecture diagram at `docs/architecture.mmd`.

### Phase 1: UI & CLI Foundations (Feature-Rich, Agent-Embedded)
#### 1.1 Design System & Navigation
- Tailwind config tokens for Sirsi palette and typography.
- `<Sidebar>` component with entries for each sub-agent's domain feature home: Overview, Migration Wizard, Credential Management, Projects, Migration Steps (Plan, Specify, Test, Build, Transfer, Validate, Optimize, Support), Analytics & Reports, Help & Tutorials.
- `<AgentChat>` overlay always available; contextual tooltips and input field assistants.

#### 1.2 Core Components & Screens
- **WelcomeModal**: JSON-driven steps, Framer Motion animations, embedded Agent greeting.
- **ProjectForm**: React Hook Form + Zod, real-time AI tips, immediate validation, icons in dropdowns.
- **AuthModal**: Tabbed Sign In/Register, OIDC flows, demo credentials section, AI prompt for MFA.
- **MigrationSteps**: Wizard flow with sub-agent interactions at each step, pre-populated real content from events.

#### 1.3 CLI Interface
- Tauri-based binary bundling Rust core and React UI.
- `sirsi` CLI with subcommands (`init`, `discover`, `assess`, `plan`, `run`, `status`, `help`) and interactive REPL mode with Agent autocompletion.

### Phase 2: Core AI Hypervisor & Sub-Agent Framework
1. **Hypervisor Core (Rust)**
   - Implement `AgentService` gRPC with methods: `StartSession`, `SpawnSubAgent(type)`, `SendMessage`, `GetSuggestions`, `GetSubAgentStatus`.
   - Context store: Redis cluster for session data, user profiles, and workspace state.
2. **Sub-Agent Manager**
   - Dynamic loading of sub-agent modules as WASM or Go binaries.
   - Domain-specific sub-agents: AzureAgent, AWSAgent, MigrationAgent, ReportingAgent, SecurityAgent, ScriptingAgent, TutorialAgent.
   - Communication bus: Agents publish and subscribe to Kafka topics: `agent.{domain}.requests`, `.responses`, `.logs`.
3. **Knowledge Graph Integration**
   - Hedera Hashgraph client in Rust to persist user interactions, resource graphs, and agent decisions as a 3D relationship map.
4. **Security Bootstrapping**
   - Configure SPIRE to issue mTLS certificates to each service and sub-agent.
   - Vault sidecar injector for dynamic secret retrieval, annotated in Kubernetes manifests.
5. **Observability Setup**
   - OpenTelemetry collector deployment, instrumentation of all services, and Kafka staging topics.

### Phase 3: Connector Framework & Discovery Sub-Agent
- Define `ConnectorRequest` and `ConnectorResponse` messages in `proto/connector.proto`.
- Implement AWSAgent, AzureAgent, GCPAgent, vSphereAgent in Go under `connectors/{provider}`.
- Each agent: Auth via SDK, resource enumeration, metadata enrichment, and publication to `discovery.events` with embedded AI prompts for optimization.
- Build a Go Testcontainers harness with LocalStack, Azurite, and Mock vSphere for CI integration tests.

### Phase 4: Assessment & Risk Sub-Agent
- Dagster pipelines in Python for `discovery.events` ingestion.
- OPA policies in `security/opa/` to evaluate compliance, sizing, OS support.
- ML-based scorer (`models/scorer.pkl`) to compute cost, performance, and security risk.
- Publish `assessment.events` with `riskScore`, `costEstimate`, `aiRecommendation`.
- AssessmentAgent listens for high-risk events and proactively messages users or opens action items.

### Phase 5: Migration Planning & Scripting Sub-Agent
- Template engine: Jinja2 (Python) & Tera (Rust) to fill `migration-templates/*.tpl` (Terraform HCL, Bicep, Pulumi TS).
- ScriptingAgent validates synthesized IaC, offers inline code-edit suggestions via AI, and writes back updated templates.
- Expose `/api/plan` endpoints for UI and CLI; generate Mermaid diagrams at `/api/plan/diagram`.

### Phase 7: Support, Monitoring & Continuous Learning
1. **Help Center**: FAQ and docs search via TutorialAgent and AgentChat.
2. **Dynamic Tutorials**: Contextual popovers and walkthroughs for every feature.
3. **Monitoring Dashboards**: Grafana + Prometheus with Agent-written daily/weekly summaries at `/api/metrics/summary`.
