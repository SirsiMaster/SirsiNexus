## 1. Executive Summary

**Goal**: Ship _Sirsi Nexus_—a unified application delivering both a cross-platform desktop single-binary and a multi-tenant hosted web app—automating heterogeneous cloud migrations and infrastructure management. Every user and every feature is supported by the _Sirsi AI Hypervisor_, which dynamically spawns specialized, parallelized _sub‑agents_ (e.g., Azure Agent, AWS Agent, Migration Agent, Reporting Agent, Security Agent, Scripting Agent) to provide deep domain knowledge, continuous monitoring, and context-aware assistance.

**Key Pillars**:

1. **Agent-First Everywhere**: The Hypervisor maintains an always-on _AgentService_ that spawns domain-specific sub-agents. Each sub-agent has full-system visibility in its domain, acts autonomously on tasks (discovery, assessment, planning, execution, reporting), and surfaces recommendations and interactive tutorials.
2. **Modular Polyglot Core**: Leverage Rust (core hypervisor, state machine), Go (connectors, sub-agent runtimes), Python (planning, AI orchestration), TypeScript/WebAssembly (UI logic), and Helm/Terraform for infrastructure. All communicate over protobuf/gRPC and an event bus (Kafka/NATS).
3. **Robust, Feature-Rich UI/UX**: Built with Next.js + React, styled via Tailwind + shadcn/ui, animated using Framer Motion. The sidebar provides one-click access to every module—Discovery, Assessment, Planning, Execution, Validation, Optimization, Reporting, Security, Scripting, FAQs, and Tutorials—each backed by live content and no empty states. A global AgentChat icon injects contextual help into every form, modal, and dashboard.
4. **Security & Compliance by Design**: Zero trust using mTLS and SPIFFE for identity, dynamic secrets via HashiCorp Vault, policy-as-code enforced by OPA at both CI and runtime, and runtime sandboxing of untrusted code modules via gVisor and eBPF-based anomaly detection.
5. **Scalable, Resilient Infrastructure**: Kubernetes Operators to manage migration CRDs, auto-scaling via HPA and custom metrics, multi-region disaster recovery with etcd replication and cross-region object storage, and event-driven workflows for high throughput.
6. **Enterprise-Grade CI/CD & Testing**: Comprehensive GitHub Actions/Azure Pipelines setup for linting (Clippy, ESLint, GoLint), unit tests (Rust, Go, Python, Jest), integration tests (Testcontainers, KIND), end-to-end UI tests (Cypress), security scans (Snyk, Trivy), and performance baselining (K6, Lighthouse).

```

**Contracts**: All services share versioned proto definitions under `core-engine/proto/*.proto`. Events adhere to schemas in `pipeline/schemas/`.

### 4.1 GUI-First Development Approach

To keep the interface "alive" during early development, the project begins by scaffolding the entire UI and CLI with mocked data. Every screen, modal and dashboard is implemented first, then real services and sub-agents replace the placeholders incrementally. This approach validates workflows early and guides backend priorities.
